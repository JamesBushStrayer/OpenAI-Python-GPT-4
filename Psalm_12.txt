There is not necessarily an exact match or high similarity to Psalm 12 in part or whole. The Psalms of the Bible are unique in their composition and message. However, there are thematic and stylistic similarities among many Psalms due to common authorship (primarily David), structure (Hebrew poetic forms), and purpose (worship, lament, thanksgiving, etc.).

Most closely related to Psalm 12 in terms of theme and content are:

1. Psalm 11: Similar to Psalm 12, it is a lament of David, where he earnestly pours out his feelings of desperation, frustration and hopelessness to God. Both psalms mirror a situation where faithful and righteous people are few, and the wicked seem to prevail.

2. Psalm 14: Shares an overarching theme with Psalm 12. Both psalms deal with the scarcity of godly people, describing how the wicked suppress or overrun the righteous. Similar expressions like, "no one does good," are found in both psalms indicating the absolute perversity of mankind.

3. Psalm 36: In these psalms, the psalmist laments about the prevailing wickedness and hypocrisy of mankind, particularly those in power. He also places his trust in Godâ€™s steadfast love and righteousness, somewhat similar to the faith David expresses in Psalm 12.

4. Psalm 140: Both psalms have David cry out to God for protection from the wicked and deceitful people who cause harm with their words. 

5. Psalm 10: Both involve a lament about the lack of justice in the world, with the wicked seemingly prospering while the righteous suffer.

6. Psalm 35: Both psalms express a heartfelt plea for God's intervention against the wicked.

7. Psalm 120: Both psalms involve pleading with God for deliverance from people who are deceitful and do harm with their words.

It should be noted that while these Psalms share themes and occasionally similar phrasing, they are not identical to Psalm 12. Each Psalm has its unique focus, language, and context, exhibiting the multifaceted nature of the human relationship with God. Whether in lamentation, profound joy, or seeking divine justice, Psalms echo across shifts in time and culture due to their powerful expression of spiritual and emotional truths.
