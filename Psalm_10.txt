Psalm 10 is a unique individual lament, which does not have an identical or nearly identical counterpart within the Book of Psalms. Its main theme is to cry out to God in times of trouble when wicked ones seem to prosper. There may be thematic similarities with other psalms, yet the content, rhetoric, narrative approach or formulation are unique to this particular psalm.

Some scholars suggest that Psalms 9 and 10 were once a single acrostic poem; they each describe the wicked and contrast them with the righteous. However, that is contested and the relationship between Psalms 9 and 10 varies among different editions of the texts.

Psalm 14 and 53 also discuss wickedness and evildoers, just like Psalm 10. They describe the characteristics of the wicked and cry out for God's justice. However, they are not identical or highly similar in form or content to Psalm 10.

Psalm 37 might also be seen as similar in its discussion of the wicked and the righteous, reassuring that the wicked will get their due. Still, the content and form are quite different from Psalm 10.

Without a detailed breakdown of the original Hebrew text in Psalm 10 and a thorough inspection of each individual psalm, it is hard to definitively list all of the psalms that are highly similar to Psalm 10. Nonetheless, it's safe to say that no psalm is identical to it, since each one showcases unique attributes and themes.
