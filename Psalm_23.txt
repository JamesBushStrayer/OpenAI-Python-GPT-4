The Bible doesn't contain any exact replicas of Psalm 23. This Psalm is unique in its wording and message, based on its context by David. However, there are several Psalms that carry similar themes such as focusing on God’s continuing care, provision, guidance, and protection. These include:

1. Psalm 27: Similar to Psalm 23, verse 1 emphasizes that the Lord is our light and salvation, and so we should not fear, much like in Psalm 23 where David states, "I shall not want." Verses 4-6 portray the safety in the house of the Lord, reminiscent of the comfort expressed in Psalm 23 in God's presence.

2. Psalm 28: Verse 7 talks about the Lord being the strength and the protective shield, similar to Psalm 23's notion of God’s protective rod and staff providing comfort.

3. Psalm 34: This psalm encourages believers to seek the Lord for refuge in times of trouble (verse 22), much like in Psalm 23 where David found comfort in God’s presence in "the valley of the shadow of death."

4. Psalm 91: This Psalm has strong similarities to Psalm 23, as both highlight the protection, care and deliverance provided by the Lord. For instance, verse 4 speaks of His faithfulness as a protective shield, similar to the concept of His rod and staff in Psalm 23.

5. Psalm 121: This is another psalm that showcases God’s guidance and protection much like Psalm 23. Verses 7-8 ensure God's protective care over all aspects of our lives.

Though these psalms share similar themes, they offer unique insights and messages. It's also essential to note that the subtle nuances and contexts contribute to each psalm's individual impact. Each psalm, including Psalm 23, carries its own precise message and expresses a unique aspect of faith, trust, and dependency on God.
